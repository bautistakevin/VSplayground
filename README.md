### 2/3/2019- added String Reversal solution.

StringReversal takes a string and puts it into a character array, then runs a for loop to swap the characters through the middle. Afterwards, the string was reversed completely, so I used a foreach loop and a Split function to unreversed them by using the same method that reversed them in the first place.

Things I learned:
- character arrays and their functionality in storing string values
- utilizing a for loop to reverse an array by dividing the array's length in half and swapping minimum index and maximum index
- returning the characters inside the array into strings by using the Split function and utilizing ' ' as the split index.
- using a foreach loop to then apply the reversal method to each individualized strings that were made by the Split function to return an unreversed string.

### 2/4/2019 - added Greatest Common Divisor and Least Common Multiple solution.
